# TSP-using-DE

The project aims to have the following features:-

The purpose of our project is to solve a travelling salesman problem in which, a salesman given a list of cities and the distance between each pair of cities, we want to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
Here we are solving this problem by using differential evolution algorithm, which is an advanced meta heuristic approach to solve this problem as it reduces the time complexity.

Travelling salesman problem was previously solved using genetic algorithm and it was not very efficient as it can't handle change in value during the execution. So using differential evolution algorithm we are trying to dynamically solve this problem so that it can be more efficient.
